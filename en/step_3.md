## Choose your model

Now itâ€™s time to work on your own project. You may be bursting with ideas already, or you may need to take a few minutes to decide on a theme you want to work with.

--- task ---

Think about the project you would like to make. You could copy one of the examples in the video on the previous steop, adapt one of them to make something different, or even come up with something completely original.

For example:
1. You could use cotton wool and a pair of blue LEDs to make your own 3D thunder cloud.
2. You could use a ping-pong ball and a red LED to make a 3D model of Mars.
3. You could use a yellow LED and create your own model of a fire-fly.

There are many questions you will need to ask yourself, before you start creating your model. Have a think about the questions below.

Choose what you want to make a model of. What craft materials will you need to make your model, and are they readily available to you?

For your model, what LED or LEDs will you need? What colours will they be? Have you got enough jumper leads for what you are planning to make?

Once you have built your model, how will the LED or LEDs be controlled. Will you need to have them light up randomly, in a regular pattern, continuously lit, or will they be controlled using mouse or keyboard events?

Will your model need to show graphics on the screen? Will you want to add sound effects to your model? Will there be a need for people using your model to be able to interact with the screen?
